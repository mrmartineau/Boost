### Boost is no longer being supported, please try out my new framework, Kickoff at https://github.com/tmwagency/kickoff/

## BOOST enhanced boilerplate framework

**BOOST** is a Boilerplate framework that's kind of a best of everything that I find useful. There's a responsive grid (inspired by the 1kbgrid), form styling and many other useful bits and pieces.

### Updates
* **27/02/2012** - Improve typography based on calculations from http://gridlover.net, add some more mixins
* **18/01/2012** - Added centred columns to the grid
* **15/01/2012** - Massive overhaul of the CSS; now LESS is used for everything. I added a new grid system, adapted from the 1kbgrid & Zurb's Foundation grid & LOADS more
* **26/11/2011** - Fairly major update: Separated boost.css into component parts for better manageability
